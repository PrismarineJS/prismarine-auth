## prismarine-auth

See the [types](../index.d.ts) for additional information on the exposed API.

### Authflow

This is the main exposed class you interact with. Every instance holds its own token cache.

#### constructor (username?: string, cacheDir?: string | CacheFactory, options?: MicrosoftAuthFlowOptions, codeCallback?: Function)

* `username` (optional, default='')
  * When using device code auth - a unique id
  * When using password auth - your microsoft account email
* `cache` (optional, default='node_modules') - Where to store cached tokens or a cache factory function. node_modules if not specified.
* `options` (optional)
  * `flow` (required) The auth flow to use. One of `live`, `msal`, `sisu`. If no `options` argument is specified, `msal` will be used.
    * `live` - Generate an XSTS token using the live.com domain which allows for user, device and title authentication. This flow will only work with Windows Live client IDs (such as official Microsoft apps, not custom Azure apps).
    * `msal` - Generates an XSTS token using MSAL (Microsoft Authentication Library) which allows for user authentication only. Use this auth flow for custom Azure apps.
    * `sisu` - See [What does sisu flow do ?](#what-does-sisu-flow-do) for more info.
  * `password` (optional) If you specify this option, we use password based auth. Note this may be unreliable.
  * `authTitle` - The client ID for the service you are logging into. When using the `msal` flow, this is your custom Azure client token. When using `live`, this is the Windows Live SSO client ID - used when authenticating as a Windows app (such as a vanilla Minecraft client). For a list of titles, see `require('prismarine-auth').Titles` and FAQ section below for more info. (Required if using `sisu` or `live` flow, on `msal` flow we fallback to a default client ID.)
  * `deviceType` (optional) if specifying an authTitle, the device type to auth as. For example, `Win32`, `iOS`, `Android`, `Nintendo`
  * `forceRefresh` (optional) boolean - Clear all cached tokens for the specified `username` to get new ones on subsequent token requests
* `codeCallback` (optional) The callback to call when doing device code auth. Otherwise, the code will be logged to the console.

#### getMsaToken () : Promise<string>

[Returns a Microsoft account access token.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/access-tokens)

#### getXboxToken (relyingParty?: string, forceRefresh?: boolean) : Promise<{ userXUID: string, userHash: string, XSTSToken: string, expiresOn: number }>

[Returns XSTS token data](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/gaming/xbox-live/api-ref/xbox-live-rest/additional/edsauthorization).

* `relyingParty` (optional, default='http://xboxlive.com') "relying party", apart of xbox auth api
* `forceRefresh` (optional, default=false) If true, we will ignore the cache and get a new token

Example usage :
```js
const { Authflow } = require('prismarine-auth')
const flow = new Authflow() // No parameters needed
flow.getXboxToken().then(console.log)
```

#### getMinecraftJavaToken (options?: { fetchEntitlements?: boolean fetchProfile?: boolean }) : Promise<{ token: string, entitlements: object, profile: object }>

Returns a Minecraft Java Edition auth token.
* If you specify `fetchEntitlements` optional option, we will check if the account owns Minecraft and return the results of the API call. Undefined if request fails.
* If you specify `fetchProfile`, we will do a call to `https://api.minecraftservices.com/minecraft/profile` for the currently signed in user and returns the results. Undefined if request fails.
* If `fetchCertificates` is set to true, we obtain profile keys from Mojang for the player which are used for chat singing.

### getMinecraftBedrockToken (publicKey: KeyObject): Promise<string[]>

Returns a Minecraft: Bedrock Edition auth token. The first parameter is a Node.js KeyObject. Please see the examples folder for example usage.

The return object are multiple JWTs returned from the auth server, from both the Mojang and Xbox steps.

### getPlayfabLogin (): Promise<GetPlayfabLoginResponse>

Returns a Playfab login response which can be used to authenticate to the Playfab API. The SessionTicket returned in the response is used when generating the MCToken.

[Returns ServerLoginResult](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/playfab/server/authentication/login-with-xbox?view=playfab-rest#serverloginresult)

### getMinecraftBedrockServicesToken ({ version }): Promise<GetMinecraftBedrockServicesResponse>

Returns an mctoken which can be used to query the minecraft-services.net/api and is also used to authenticate the WebSocket connection for the NetherNet WebRTC signalling channel.

The return object contains the `mcToken` and `treatments` relating to the features the user has access to.

### Titles

* A list of known client IDs for convenience. Currently exposes `MinecraftNintendoSwitch` and `MinecraftJava`. These should be passed to `Authflow` options constructor (make sure to set appropriate `deviceType`).

Example usage :
```js
const { Authflow, Titles } = require('prismarine-auth')
const flow = new Authflow('', './', { authTitle: Titles.MinecraftNintendoSwitch, deviceType: 'Nintendo', flow: 'live' })
flow.getMinecraftJavaToken().then(console.log)
```

### Cache

prismarine-auth uses caching to ensure users don't have to constantly sign in when authenticating to Microsoft/Xbox services. By default, if you pass a String value to Authflow's `cacheDir` function call argument, we'll use the local file system to store and retrieve data to build a cache. However, in some circumstances, you may not have access to the local file system, or have a more advanced use-case that requires database retreival, for example. In these scenarios, you can implement cache storage and retreval yourself to match your needs.

If you pass a function to Authflow's `cacheDir` function call argument, you are expected to return a *factory method*, which means your function should instantiate and return a class or an object that implements the interface [defined here](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/prismarine-auth/blob/cf0957495458dc7cb0f2579d97b13d682be27d8f/index.d.ts#L125) and copied below:


```typescript
// Return the stored value, this can be called multiple times
getCached(): Promise<any>
// Replace the stored value
setCached(value: any): Promise<void>
// Replace an part of the stored value. Implement this using the spread operator
setCachedPartial(value: any): Promise<void>
```

Your cache function itself will be passed an object with the following properties:

```js
{
  username: string, // Name of the user we're trying to get a token for
  cacheName: string, // Depends on the cache usage, each cache has a unique name
}
```

As an example of usage, you could create a minimal in memory cache like this (note that the returned class instance implements all the functions in the interface linked above):

```js
class InMemoryCache {
  private cache = {}
  async reset () {
    // (should clear the data in the cache like a first run)
  }
  async getCached () {
    return this.cache
  }
  async setCached (value) {
    this.cache = value
  }
  async setCachedPartial (value) {
    this.cache = {
      ...this.cache,
      ...value
    }
  }
}

function cacheFactory ({ username, cacheName }) {
  return new InMemoryCache()
}
// Passed like `new Authflow('bob', cacheFactory, ...)`
```

## FAQ

### What does "authTitle" do ?

* The auth title is the "Client ID" used for authenticating to Microsoft. [This is apart of Oauth.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-client-creds-grant-flow)
* By specifying it, the library will do the full authentication sequence which includes contacting the "Xbox Title Server".
  * For any Microsoft account with a date of birth under 18, this is required
  * On Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, servers can additionally verify if you have done the full auth sequence or not, and can kick you if you have not.
  * You will get an error if you don't specify it when calling `getMinecraftJavaToken` or `getMinecraftBedrockToken` when doing device code auth. You can set it to `false` to skip signing.
* If you just want an Microsoft/Xbox token, you do not need to specify a authTitle.
* If doing password auth authTitle will not be used and should be removed.
* If specifying this, you also should provide a `deviceType`, see the doc above

### What does sisu flow do ?

* We will generate an XSTS token using the sisu flow which is utilised in some Xbox mobile apps.
* This flow allows generation of tokens for authTitles that normally wouldn't work using the other flows, such as XboxAppIOS, XboxGamepassIOS and MinecraftJava.
* This flow will not currently work for custom Azure apps
* When specifying this, you should also provide an `authTitle` and a corresponding `deviceType`. For example `{ authTitle: Titles.MinecraftJava, deviceType: 'Win32' }` failing this will cause a Forbidden HTTP error.
